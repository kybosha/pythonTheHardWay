	become clear he realised he was lying on his side surrounded by a quilt of fallen autumn leaves, as he shifted his weight they crunched underneath him clunging to his clothes 
	while he pushed himself up. Craning his neck he could see he was surrounded by woodland, it was extremely dark though 
	so he could only see the first row of trees. The only light source available was the dull glow of the moon, it excentuated the silhouettes of the objects that surrounded him but 
	didn't reveal any more detail. There was a break in the trees far off to his right and stationed in front of it was a small car, he couldn't make out much more than that due to 
	the low visibility.\n Suddenly there was a bang behind him, he jolted round he found himself outside the front of an old wooden house, it was a 2 storey cabin. Agahst he scanned 
	the front of the house erratically searching for the source of the noise. All was quiet though. Too quiet he thought, there were no animal noises, no trees rustling in the wind. 
	In fact there was no wind at all. The back of his head began to throb again causing him to double over as he clutched at the swollen lump pertruding from it. ****WRITE MORE***
